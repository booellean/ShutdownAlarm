#### Purpose of Project

This is a small test application which serves three purposes:

  1. To serve as an example of my current skillsets with C# and the .Net Framework.
  2. To further those skills in a practical development environment.
  3. To create a functional shutdown/alarm timer that works optimally in a Windows environment (especially since the author could not find any Windows Applications with a UI that they preferred).

#### ToDo:

  - Finalize the Design and UI of form elements
  - Clean up code to proper standardiztion
  - Create a background environment
  - Updates as needed
  - Publish to Windows App Store
